    "Don't use generic subject lines ('Newsletter #5', 'Monthly Update')",
    "Don't bury the value - lead with benefit",

    "Don't use multiple competing CTAs - prioritize one primary action",
    "Don't forget mobile users - keep subject short, CTA obvious",
    "Don't oversell - let features speak for themselves",
    "Don't ignore segmentation - tailor to user's current state",
    "Don't send without testing links and images",
    "Don't use spam trigger words (FREE!!!, ACT NOW, LIMITED TIME!!!)",
    "Don't forget personalization - address as 'Wizard', reference behavior",
    "Don't use too many exclamation points - one per email max",
    "Don't make unsubscribe hard to find",
    "Don't send without A/B testing subject lines",
    "Don't ignore send time optimization",
